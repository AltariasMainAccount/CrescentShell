# CrescentShell
## Introduction
This is the official repository for CrescentShell.
CrescentShell is, obviously, a shell replacement for the regular shell (like bash).

This is not supposed to be used outside of fun stuff. It's not really intended to be used as it was intended.

## Features
Currently we are on 0.7.1 of CrescentShell. Most of the important features like pipeline to shell, configurations and things like that have indeed been implemented.
Other features may be implemented in another branch or another repository entirely.
